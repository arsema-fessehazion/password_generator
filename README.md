# password_generator

Activity set from the 100 days of code course on Udemy

Easy version:
Creates a randomised password in the format of letters, symbols, numbers

Hard version:
Creates the password initially in list format so that this then can be randomised and shuffled as so not to have a set pattern of letters, symbols and numbers. The password is then reassigned to string format after shuffling.
